# Hunt Sanity Thresholds

## How to Use

This lists each ghosts maximum hunt sanity threshold. If a ghost initiates a non-cursed hunt, check the average sanity of the crew. Find the lowest sanity that is greater than or equal to the current average sanity. You can safely eliminate all ghosts below this on the table from being the ghost type.

## Hunt Sanity Threshold Table

| Ghost Type     | Sanity Threshold |
| -------------- | :--------------: |
| Demon          |       100%       |
| The Mimic      |     100%[^1]     |
| Banshee        |    87.5%[^2]     |
| Yokai          |       80%        |
| Thaye          |       75%        |
| Raiju          |       65%        |
| Mare           |       60%        |
| Onryo          |     60%[^3]      |
| _Other Ghosts_ |       50%        |
| Shade          |       35%        |

[^1]: The mimic can mimic the sanity threshold for any other ghost, giving it the possibility to mimic the demon.

[^2]: The banshee technically has a sanity threshold of 50%, but it only considers the hunt target's sanity, allowing it to hunt as high as 87.5% average sanity.

[^3]: The onryo can hunt at any sanity if it blows out three flames. If this does not happen, the onryo will only hunt at 60% or lower.
